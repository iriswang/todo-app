# Android To Do App
This is the first android app I've written and it is a todo list app that allows users to save, edit, and delete tasks. To use the app,
there is a plus sign on the top of the toolbar for adding tasks. In the main view of the app, users can tap on a task to view/ edit the
details of that app and users can long click on a task to delete the task. There is also a navigation drawer that lets users 
view tasks that are due today versus all the tasks they've ever created.
